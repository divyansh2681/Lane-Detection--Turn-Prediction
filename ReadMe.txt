The purpose of this project is to make students understand the concepts of histogram equalization, adaptive histogram equalization, homography, warping, and hough transform. In the first question, histogram equalization and adaptive histogram equalization had to be performed on a set of 25 images. In the second question, lane detection had to be performed for a given video, this was done using hough transform. In the last question, turn prediction had to be performed. For this homography, warping and hough transform were used. 

Please use any python editor to open the codes and make sure to change the path of the source images and videos.
